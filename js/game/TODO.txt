1. Configure gravity to be more moon-like				- COMPLETE 2/4/17
2. Allow sprite rotation and angular velocity			- COMPLETE 2/4/17
3. In the collision callback, calculate velocity of the colliding body and determine if it is too fast for a successful landing.
	3a. Also, check the rotation and make sure it is 0 degrees +- 5
